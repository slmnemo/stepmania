StepMania
=========

StepMania is an advanced cross-platform rhythm game for home and arcade use.

This is a fork of Stepmania modified for a 9-panel gamemode and to include NFC scanning capabilities. The default theme can be found on my profile under DGPTheme.

Compiled using [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/). More information about using CMake can be found in both the `Build` directory and CMake's documentation.

## Resources

* Lua API Documentation can be found in the Docs folder.

## Licensing Terms

In short- you can do anything you like with the game (including sell products made with it), provided you *do not*:

1. Sell the game *with the included songs*
2. Claim to have created the engine yourself or remove the credits
3. Not provide source code for any build which differs from any official release which includes MP3 support.
